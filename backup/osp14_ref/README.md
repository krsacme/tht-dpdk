OSP14 OvS-DPDK Deployment
=========================

* Enabled Routed Network
* Enabled OvS-DPDK 


Notes:
* External Network is configured via the ControlPlane for the hybrid
  deployments, this is not an ideal way, but for hybrid deployments,
  it reduces the number of additional steps in configuration. Refer
  the network_data_yyy.yaml files for details.
